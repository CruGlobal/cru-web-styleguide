- Always work in a branch

- Avoid unnecessary merges of master into your branch - if you are the only person working on your branch, rebase onto master instead. Use `git pull --rebase` to avoid commits like: Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/master' into jd-feature.

- Squash your commits into meaningful and (release/revert)able chunks.

- Merge with --no-ff back into master when it has been code reviewed (or merge through a GUI; we use Tower).

- Make your commit messages useful, no jokes. [Follow Git commit message best practices](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html) as much as possible (first line should be a <= 50 character summary of your changes, followed by a blank line and, if appropriate for larger changes, a detailed description wrapped to approx. 72 characters).
